## Removable Storage

To access content on external storage, manually connect to the removable-media plug:

```
snap connect obs-studio:removable-media
```

## OBS Virtual Camera

Starting with OBS Studio 26.1, Virtual Camera support is integrated. Here's
how to install and configure `v4l2loopback` which OBS uses:

```
sudo snap connect obs-studio:kernel-module-observe
sudo apt -y install v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils
echo "options v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=13 card_label='OBS Virtual Camera' exclusive_caps=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf
echo "v4l2loopback" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf
sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=13 card_label='OBS Virtual Camera' exclusive_caps=1
```

The `Start Virtual Camera` button is located in the Controls pane, just below `Start Recording`.

**NOTE!** Using `video_nr` greater than 64 will not work.

## NDI

If you want to use the [NDI](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi) plugin you'll
need to connect the Avahi Control interface.

```
snap connect obs-studio:avahi-control
```

## Browser

Optional interfaces can be connected that integrate with Browser Sources and Custom Browser Socks.

### Process Control

The OBS Browser does attempt to adjust the scheduler priority, you can enable this capability by optionally connecting the `process-control` interface.

```
snap connect obs-studio:process-control
```

### Passwords and Keys

The browser in OBS can obtain user credentials from applications such as GNOME Passwords and Keys (seahorse) or Kwallet, should you want it to.

```
snap connect obs-studio:password-manager-service
```

## gPhoto

The [gPhoto](https://github.com/adlerweb/obs-gphoto) plugin is bundled and
allows DSLR cameras (mostly Canon) to be connected with obs-studio via USB.
You will need to connect the Raw USB interface.

```
snap connect obs-studio:raw-usb
```

## ALSA & Jack audio

If you use ALSA or Jack audio the you can enable interfaces to those audio systems.

    sudo snap connect obs-studio:alsa
    sudo snap connect obs-studio:jack1

## 3rd Party plugins

You might find that this modified snap of OBS Studio doesn't include a plugin that you use.
To install pre-compiled plugins, download and extract the plugin and put it in
`~/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/`.

For example, this is how the [Input Overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay)
plugin looks when correctly installed:

```
/home/username/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/
└── input-overlay
    ├── bin
    │   └── 64bit
    │       └── input-overlay.so
    └── data
        └── locale
            ├── de-DE.ini
            ├── en-US.ini
            └── ru-RU.ini
```

### Input Overlay

This snap of OBS Studio comes with `libuihook` and `netlib` pre-installed so
that if you want to use the [Input Overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay)
plugin, you can install it as outlined above then connect the joystick
interface as follows.

```
snap connect obs-studio:joystick
```

*The Input Overlay plugin is not shipped by default in the OBS Studio snap
because it introduced excessive CPU utilisation when bundled, although
works fine as a user-installed plugin. So we've made it as easy as possible
to add it yourself should you need it.*

### DroidCam OBS

If you want to use [DroidCam OBS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev47apps.obsdroidcam)
you will need to install the accompanying plugin.

  * Download the [DroidCam OBS Plugin for Linux](http://dev47apps.com/obs/)
  * Extract the `droidcam_obs_1.1.1_linux.zip` archive.
  * Put the plugin in `~/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/`.

```
mv droidcam-obs ~/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/
```

This is how the DroidCam OBS plugin looks when correctly installed:

```
/home/username/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/
└── droidcam-obs
    ├── bin
    │   └── 64bit
    │       └── droidcam-obs.so
    └── data
        └── locale
            └── en-US.ini
```
